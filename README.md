## Project Overview
The project aims to uncover patterns and insights in Lupus disease management by analyzing patient and healthcare data using SQL. Through SQL queries and data visualization, the project explores aspects such as patient demographics, visit frequency, medication prescriptions, and test results to help improve understanding and care strategies for Lupus.

## Data Sources
Created a tables in MySQl of following
* **Patient Data:** Details such as demographics, Lupus type, and diagnosis date.
* **Doctor Data:** Information on doctors, their specialties, and associated hospitals.
* **Visits Data:** Records of each patient visit, symptoms reported, and treatments prescribed.
* **Medication Data:** Information on medications prescribed to Lupus patients.
* **Lab Results Data:** Diagnostic test results, test types, and associated visit information.

## Skills and Tools Used
* **SQL:** For data extraction, transformation, and analysis (joins, filtering, aggregation).
* **Database Management:** MySQL for managing and querying relational data.

## Project Scope
* Analyze patient demographics and Lupus type distribution.
* Identify the frequency and purpose of patient visits to specific specialists.
* Analyze medication prescriptions and their frequency across different types of Lupus.
* Evaluate diagnostic test results for trend analysis in patient health outcomes.
* Provide data-driven insights to support better treatment and resource allocation.
## Results/Findings
* **Patient Demographics:** Systemic Lupus is the most common type, with higher prevalence in certain age groups and demographics.
* **Visit Trends:** Patients with Systemic Lupus require frequent visits to rheumatologists, especially for recurring symptoms like joint pain.
* **Medication Insights:** Prednisone is the most frequently prescribed medication, often in combination with Hydroxychloroquine.
* **Diagnostic Trends:** Elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies were commonly found in patients with more severe Lupus types, highlighting the need for focused monitoring.
* These insights demonstrate the power of SQL-based data analysis in identifying trends that can inform better patient management strategies for Lupus care.
